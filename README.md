ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alanvnorcott

- Iâ€™m a Software Engineer focused on backend development and database systems. Professionally, I work with C#, ASP.NET, and SQL Server to build scalable APIs, integrate frontends, and optimize complex queries.
- For personal projects, I usually turn to Python; Itâ€™s my go-to for experimenting with ideas, automation, and building tools.
- This GitHub is where I consolidate both professional and personal projects as I transition everything off my old student account.
