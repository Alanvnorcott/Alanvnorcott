(THIS IS NOW MY NEW GITHUB)
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alanvnorcott
- I hope to one day be able to use my knowledge and skill in the field of computer science to better the world,
- whether that be through the development of new software or through creating systems of protection for existing ones.
(NOTE: I am slowly migrating everything from my student GitHub to this one, I just created this GitHub for the sake of keeping everything consolidated)
